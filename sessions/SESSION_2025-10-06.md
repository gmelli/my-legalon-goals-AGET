# Session Notes - 2025-10-06

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Type:** Initial Setup & Goal Context Gathering
**Duration:** ~2-3 hours
**Agent:** my-legalon-goals-AGET v2.5.1

---

## Session Objective

Set up goals management agent and gather context for 2H FY2025 goal planning.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Agent Identity Established
- ✅ Created agent vision/mission/goals (`data/goals/agent_vision_mission_goals.md`)
- ✅ Created capabilities document (`docs/capabilities.md`)
- ✅ Updated README with VMG summary
- ✅ Set current priority: 2H FY2025 goal reporting (the crunch)

### 2. Context Gathered from CCB Handoff
- ✅ Read handoff document from my-ccb-AGET
- ✅ Created main backgrounder (`data/backgrounders/2025-10-05_legalon_2h_goal_planning.md`)
- ✅ Created CRB backgrounder (`data/backgrounders/contract_review_benchmark.md`)
- ✅ Captured decision tracking (`workspace/2h_goal_structure_decisions.md`)

### 3. Clarifying Questions Asked & Answered
- ✅ Q1 (AI Review F1 >= 0.9): COMPLETED via Ancalagon, don't carry to 2H
- ✅ Q2 (Thought Leadership): CRB engagement (still need metrics)
- ✅ Q3 (Time Savings): 10-minute contract review PoC, Q3 demo
- ✅ Q4 (SWAT Team): Implicit in US dev support
- ✅ Q5 (Goal Structure): Hybrid pattern (product + theme)
- ✅ Q6 (Product Coverage): Accuracy, Data Infrastructure, Team Building

### 4. Rippling Goals State Captured
- ✅ Created 1H FY2025 actual state document (`data/goals/1h_fy2025_rippling_actual.md`)
- ✅ Documented stale percentage problem (all 0% but work done)
- ✅ Captured 5 goals: AI Review, GenAI Hiring, Playbook Agent, MyPlaybook benchmark, Thought Leadership
- ✅ Updated GenAI Hiring to 50% (1 DS ✓, 1 GenAI Engineer KR)

### 5. LegalOn Product Hierarchy Documented
**Accuracy Umbrella:**
- AI Revise (automated redlining)
- AI Review (issue-spotting with Ancalagon LLM)
- Playbook Agent (custom guidelines, launching ~mid-Nov)

**Data Infrastructure:**
- Contract Database (public contracts, clauses, templates)
- LOA Session Analysis (expanded volume/depth)
- User-Session Data Capture (privacy/RTBF challenges)

**Key Technologies:**
- Ancalagon (custom LLM rule inference, achieved F1 >= 0.9)
- CRB - Contract Review Benchmark (nascently live, v2, genai-ops repo)

**Teams:**
- GenAI Team (Gabor's direct team)
- US Dev Team (2 AI Engineers + 2 SWEs, SWAT experiment)

### 6. Lessons Learned Documented
- ✅ Created lessons learned file (`.aget/evolution/2025-10-06_initial_setup_lessons.md`)
- ✅ What worked: systematic context gathering, question-driven approach
- ✅ What didn't: premature completion marking, verbose filenames
- ✅ Key insights: Rippling constraints, LegalOn products, goal patterns

---

## Key Decisions

### Structure
- **2H Goal Pattern:** Hybrid (product + theme based organization)
- **Goal Limits:** Max 5 goals, 4-5 key results each
- **Document Organization:** data/ (persistent), workspace/ (working), backgrounders/ (context)

### 2H Priorities Identified
1. Playbook Agent production launch (~mid-Nov)
2. CRB engagement (thought leadership, PR spear)
3. 10-minute contract review PoC (Q3 demo)
4. Contract Database (new data infrastructure)
5. LOA Session Analysis (expanded analysis)
6. User-Session Data Capture (privacy challenges)

### 1H Updates Needed
- AI Review: 0% → 100% (Ancalagon complete)
- GenAI Hiring: 50% (current, accurate)
- Playbook Agent: 0% → 50-75% (in progress)
- MyPlaybook benchmark: Status unclear, needs clarification
- Thought Leadership: Update based on CRB v2 completion

---

## Open Questions for Next Session

1. **CRB engagement metrics** - What defines success? (presentations? pilots? publications?)
2. **MyPlaybook benchmark status** - Goal #4 from 1H, what's the real progress?
3. **Time savings metric clarity** - Is 7.41% a real measure? Still relevant?
4. **Missing 1H goals** - Were there 7 goals total? CCB mentioned 2 not in Rippling data shown
