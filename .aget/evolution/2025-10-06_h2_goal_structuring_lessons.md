# H2 FY2025 Goal Structuring - Lessons Learned

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Session:** H2 Goal Structuring (Session 3)
**Agent:** my-legalon-goals-AGET v2.5.1

---

## Session Overview

Structured 9+ priorities into 5 SMART goals for 2H FY2025, incorporating CEO mandate (brand awareness), H1 lessons learned, and clarifying ambiguous priorities.

---

## What Worked Well

### 1. Iterative Refinement Process
**Approach:** Started with 6 priorities → expanded to 9 → clustered down to 5 goals
- Multiple rounds of clarification before finalizing
- User corrections caught ambiguities early
- Each iteration improved clarity and actionability

**Why it worked:**
- Avoided premature commitment to structure
- User had agency to shape goal names and groupings
- Built understanding incrementally

### 2. Three-Question Framework
**Asked three strategic questions:**
1. Q1: Hiring goals for H2? (Answer: Yes, 3 AI Engineers)
2. Q2: Must-haves vs can-defer? (Identified 6 must-haves, 1 stretch, 2 defers)
3. Q3: How to frame accuracy goals? (Answer: "Noticeable in measurable way")

**Why it worked:**
- Forced prioritization decisions
- Surfaced constraints (9 priorities → 5 goals)
- Aligned on risk framing for accuracy goals

### 3. Goal Title Evolution
**Pattern:** User corrected goal titles through multiple rounds to emphasize action
- "Excellence" → "Adoption" (action-oriented)
- "Launch Playbook Agent" → "Playbook Agent Adoption" (outcome-focused)
- Removed parentheticals (cleaner, less stuttering)
- Kept titles concise without marketing fluff

**Lesson:** Goal titles should be action-oriented, outcome-focused, and marketing-brief

### 4. Clustering by Strategic Theme
**Successful clusters:**
- Brand Awareness + Thought Leadership (CRB fits naturally)
- Playbook Agent: Launch + Efficiency (lifecycle approach)
- Data Infrastructure + Development Acceleration (CEO mandate integration)

**Why it worked:**
- Reduced goal count while preserving all priorities
- Created coherent narratives
- Aligned with company-level mandates

### 5. Incorporating CEO Goals
**Daniel's brand awareness goal → Goal 1 umbrella**
- CRB engagement fits thought leadership pattern
- NPS/review ratings complement external positioning
- Removed marketing metrics that weren't user's direct responsibility

**Lesson:** When manager adds goals, find natural integration points (umbrella structure works well)

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. "Max 5 Goals" Assumption
**Problem:** Stated "max 5 goals" as hard limit without verification
**User correction:** "Actually where did you read that it must only be 5?"
**Source:** Came from CCB handoff backgrounder, never verified as Rippling platform constraint

**Lesson:** Verify system constraints, don't assume from handoff documents

### 2. Premature Commentary in Drafts
**Problem:** User requested "just make it clean without commentary" after seeing options/explanations in goal draft
**Pattern:** Over-explained during iteration rounds

**Lesson:** Once structure is clear, present cleanly without meta-commentary

### 3. Initial Priority Descriptions Too Vague
**Examples:**
- "Contract Database" → needed "Public Contract Database" clarification
- "LOA Session Analysis" → never clarified what "expanded volume/depth" means
- "User-Session Data Capture" → scope remained unclear (but deferred)

**Lesson:** Get specific definitions for all priorities before clustering

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Goal Structuring is Iterative Title Refinement
- Started with descriptive titles ("Playbook Agent Production & Efficiency")
- User corrected to action verbs ("Drive Playbook Agent Adoption")
- Further refined to outcomes ("Playbook Agent Adoption")
- Removed parentheticals and marketing language

**Pattern:** Descriptive → Action → Outcome → Clean

### 2. Accuracy Goals Need Risk Framing
**H1 lesson applied:** "Accuracy improvement goals are risky"
**H2 approach:** Frame as "noticeable in measurable way"
- Not "excellence" (too vague, too marketing-y)
- Not "increase by X%" (may be unachievable)
- Yes "improve with measurable baseline → target"

### 3. Development Acceleration is Strategic Priority
**CEO mandate:** Speed up release process
**Connection:** AGET framework (automation for faster delivery)
**Integration:** Became part of Goal 4 (Data Infrastructure & Development Acceleration)
**Specific:** Automate QA for AI Review/Revise releases (operational pain point)

**Lesson:** Look for automation/acceleration opportunities that tie to company strategy

### 4. Adoption > Features
**User corrections:**
- "Playbook Agent Launch" → "Playbook Agent Adoption"
- "My Playbooks Excellence" → "My Playbooks Adoption"

**Pattern:** Success measured by usage, not just delivery

### 5. "~10% of reviews" vs "~10% of accounts"
**Correction:** Playbooks created should be % of reviews (contract reviews), not % of accounts
**Insight:** Success metric tied to transaction volume, not user base
**Lesson:** Clarify denominator for percentage-based KRs

## Process Improvements for Next Time

### 1. Verify System Constraints Early
- Ask about goal limits upfront
- Don't assume from handoff docs
- Confirm with user or Rippling documentation

### 2. Define Priorities Before Clustering
- Get specific descriptions for all priorities first
- Clarify ambiguous terms (LOA "expanded volume/depth")
- Establish baselines and targets before structuring

### 3. Use Clean Presentation Once Structure Emerges
- Options and commentary helpful early in process
- Clean presentation better once direction is clear
- Toggle modes based on session phase

### 4. Title Refinement Pattern
- Start with descriptive titles to build shared understanding
- Iterate to action verbs and outcomes
- Remove parentheticals and marketing language
- Final titles should be concise, action-oriented, outcome-focused

---

## Patterns Confirmed

### 1. Hiring Goals: Still Reliable 100%
- H2 includes 3 AI Engineer hires
- Pattern continues from 2H FY2024 and 1H FY2025
- Always include hiring goals for reliable completions

### 2. CEO-Driven Goals Require Integration
- Daniel added brand awareness goal mid-planning
- Successfully integrated as Goal 1 umbrella
- CRB engagement naturally fits

### 3. Product Goals Cluster Well
- Playbook Agent: launch + efficiency
- My Playbooks: accuracy + adoption
- Separate goals for separate products (even if related)

### 4. External Dependencies Flagged Early
- Playbook Agent launch delayed in H1 (external dependencies)
- H2: Explicit ~Nov 7 date in KR (acknowledges uncertainty)
- Lesson: Build buffers and flag dependencies

---

## Open Questions Still Unresolved

### SMART Metrics Still Needed:
1. CRB engagement: What's measurable? (LinkedIn likes/messages count?)
2. NPS results: Target score? Baseline?
3. Review site ratings: Which sites? Target rating?
4. Workflow efficiency: Current creation time vs target?
5. F1 improvement: Current baseline? Target?
6. Revision recommendation score: Current vs target?
7. Usage/stickiness: What metrics? (sessions? retention?)
8. Public Contract Database: How many contracts/clauses/templates?
9. QA automation: What defines success? (% automated? time savings?)
10. 10-min PoC: Demo definition? Success criteria?

### Deferred Priorities:
- LOA Session Analysis (H2 or later?)
- User-Session Data Capture (H2 or later?)

---

## What to Do Differently Next Cycle

### 1. Start with Constraints
- Verify goal limits
- Confirm KR limits
- Understand platform capabilities

### 2. Baseline Data First
- Get current metrics before setting targets
- Avoid "noticeable improvement" without baselines
- Frame accuracy goals with risk mitigation

### 3. Action Verbs from Start
- Don't use "excellence", "improve", "increase" alone
- Add "adoption", "drive", "accelerate" for outcomes
- Keep titles short and action-focused

### 4. CEO Alignment Early
- Ask about company-level goals upfront
- Find natural integration points
- Don't duplicate or conflict
