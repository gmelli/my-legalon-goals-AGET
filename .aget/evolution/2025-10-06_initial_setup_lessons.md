# Lessons Learned - Initial Setup Session

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Session:** Initial agent setup and goal context gathering
**Type:** Setup & Configuration

---

## What Worked Well

### 1. Systematic Context Gathering
- Started with handoff document from my-ccb-AGET
- Created backgrounders immediately (`data/backgrounders/`)
- Tracked decisions in workspace (`workspace/2h_goal_structure_decisions.md`)
- Result: Complete context preserved for 2H goal structuring

### 2. Question-Driven Approach
- Asked 6 clarifying questions upfront (Q1-Q6)
- Got concrete answers progressively
- Recorded decisions as they came in
- Result: No assumptions, all decisions documented

### 3. Document Organization
- Created separate backgrounders for CRB, 2H planning, 1H Rippling state
- Maintained bidirectional links between documents
- Clear separation: data/ (persistent) vs workspace/ (working)
- Result: Easy to find context later

### 4. Real Data Capture
- Got actual Rippling goals structure (manual paste)
- Captured stale percentage problem (all 0% but work done)
- Documented gap between Rippling KRs and actual hiring
- Result: Accurate baseline for 2H planning

---

## What Didn't Work

### 1. Premature "Completed" Status
- Marked Q2 (Thought Leadership) as ✅ when still needed engagement metrics
- Should have used ⚠️ (partially answered) instead
- Learning: Don't mark complete until ALL requirements met

### 2. Overly Long Rename
- Suggested `AGET_FRAMEWORK_MISSION.md` as filename
- User correctly rejected as "horrible"
- Learning: Keep filenames short and clear, not verbose

### 3. Reading Framework Mission When Not Needed
- User asked "what is your vision/mission/goals?"
- Agent read BOTH agent VMG and framework mission
- Framework mission was noise for this question
- Learning: Distinguish between agent-specific and framework docs in searches

## Key Insights

### About Rippling Goals
- **System constraints:** Max 5 goals, 4-5 KRs each, "uncomfortably ambitious"
- **Pattern options:** Flat (A), Nested (B), Hybrid - user chose Hybrid
- **Real problem:** Stale percentages (0% shown but work completed)
- **Manual process:** No API access, all updates are manual pastes

### About LegalOn Products
- **Accuracy umbrella:** AI Revise, AI Review, Playbook Agent
- **Data infrastructure:** Contract DB, LOA analysis, user-session capture
- **Key tech:** Ancalagon (F1 >= 0.9 achieved), CRB (v2, nascently live)
- **Teams:** GenAI (direct), US Dev (support for SWAT experiment)

### About Goal Patterns
- 1H goals were all flat (Pattern A)
- 2H will use hybrid (product + theme based)
- Historical pattern: Hiring goals complete, Presentation goals don't
- 2H FY2025 is "the crunch" (current priority)

---

## Decisions Made

### Structure
- **2H Pattern:** Hybrid (product + theme based organization)
- **Documents:** Separate backgrounders per topic, workspace for decisions
- **VMG Location:** `data/goals/agent_vision_mission_goals.md`

### Goals Clarified
- **Q1 (AI Review F1):** COMPLETED in 1H via Ancalagon, don't carry to 2H
- **Q2 (Thought Leadership):** CRB engagement, still need metrics
- **Q3 (Time Savings):** 10-minute contract review PoC, Q3 demo
- **Q4 (SWAT Team):** Implicit in US dev support, not explicit goal
- **Q5 (Structure):** Hybrid pattern (product + theme)
- **Q6 (Coverage):** Accuracy, Data Infrastructure, Team Building

### Improvements Made
- Added VMG summary to README (Vision, Mission, My Goals)
- Enhanced wake up would show: priority, 1H status, products tracked
- All backgrounders cross-linked

## Action Items for Next Session

### Immediate
1. Get CRB engagement metrics from Gabor (presentations? pilots? publications?)
2. Clarify MyPlaybook benchmark status (goal #4 from 1H)
3. Get final confirmation on 2H structure preferences

### 2H Goal Structuring
1. Update 1H percentages in Rippling (via Gabor)
   - AI Review: 0% → 100% (Ancalagon complete)
   - GenAI Hiring: Keep at 50% (partial)
   - Playbook Agent: 0% → 50-75% (in progress)
   - MyPlaybook benchmark: Clarify status
   - Thought Leadership: Update based on CRB v2 completion

2. Draft 2H goal structure
   - Use hybrid pattern
   - Max 5 goals, 4-5 KRs each
   - Connect to active projects (Playbook Agent, CRB, 10-min PoC, Contract DB, LOA, user-session)
   - Apply SMART criteria
   - Manager alignment before finalization

### Documentation
1. Maintain session notes in `sessions/`
2. Keep decision tracking current in `workspace/`
3. Update backgrounders as priorities evolve
4. Document patterns (what completes, what stalls)

---

## Metrics

**Session Duration:** ~2-3 hours
**Documents Created:** 6 (backgrounders, goals, capabilities, README, decisions)
**Clarifying Questions:** 6 asked, 4 fully answered, 2 partially answered
**Rippling Goals Captured:** 5 (1H FY2025)
**Products Documented:** 9 (AI Revise, AI Review, Playbook Agent, CRB, Ancalagon, Contract DB, LOA analysis, user-session capture, SWAT)

---

## Template Learning

**What this agent should always do:**
1. Start with backgrounders before jumping to action
2. Ask clarifying questions for ambiguous goals
3. Document decisions as they're made (workspace/)
4. Capture real system state (Rippling screenshots)
5. Cross-link documents bidirectionally
6. Distinguish between "in progress" and "complete"

**What this agent should avoid:**
1. Making assumptions about goal metrics/timelines
2. Marking things complete when details still missing
3. Creating verbose filenames (keep it simple)
4. Reading framework docs when user asks about agent specifics

---

**Next Session Focus:** Get remaining clarifications, update 1H percentages, draft 2H goals structure
