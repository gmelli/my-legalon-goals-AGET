## Key Observations

1. **Strong overall performance:** 81.67% completion across 5 goals
2. **Three perfect completions:** AI Review (100%), GenAI Hiring (100%), Thought Leadership (100%)
3. **Playbook Agent delays:** External dependencies (Nozo's infra decision, Premium project) impacted delivery
4. **Stale tracking problem:** Company-wide pattern of 0% goals despite completed work undermines credibility
5. **Flat structure:** Pattern A (simple key results under parent goal) - worked well for H1
6. **Backfilling practice:** AI Revise v2 (H2 work) backfilled to H1 completion - questionable but accepted

## Final H1 Status Summary

**✅ Completed (3 of 5):**
- AI Review accuracy: Ancalagon + LIMA framework achieved F1 >= 0.9
- GenAI Hiring: Both roles filled (Data Scientist + NLP Engineer) + backfill
- Thought Leadership: KDD2025 session chair delivered

**⚠️ Partial (2 of 5):**
- Playbook Agent: 33.33% (development complete, deployment/usage pending → H2)
- MyPlaybook benchmarking: 75% (3 of 4 KRs complete, NLU accuracy improvement unsuccessful)

**Key Takeaway:** H1 delivered strong results despite tracking system not reflecting reality until final review.
