## Still To Define

**SMART Criteria - Need specific metrics for:**

1. **CRB engagement:** What's measurable? (LinkedIn likes/messages count? Threshold?)
2. **NPS results:** Target score? Baseline?
3. **Review site ratings:** Which sites? Target rating?
4. **Workflow efficiency:** Current creation time vs target?
5. **F1 improvement:** Current baseline? Target? (frame as "noticeable in measurable way")
6. **Revision recommendation score:** Current vs target?
7. **Usage/stickiness:** What metrics? (sessions? retention? contracts reviewed?)
8. **Public Contract Database:** How many contracts/clauses/templates?
9. **QA automation:** What defines success? (% automated? time savings? release frequency?)
10. **10-min PoC:** Demo definition? Success criteria?

## Key Decisions Made

1. ✅ Brand Awareness umbrella includes Thought Leadership (CRB)
2. ✅ Clustered Playbook Agent launch + efficiency into single goal
3. ✅ Separated My Playbooks from Playbook Agent (different products)
4. ✅ Data Infrastructure broadened to include development acceleration
5. ✅ Kept hiring as standalone goal (reliable 100% completion)
6. ✅ 10-min PoC as stretch goal (not must-have)
7. ✅ Deferred: LOA Session Analysis, User-Session Data Capture

## Next Steps

1. Define SMART metrics for all KRs
2. Apply H1 lessons learned (dependency flagging, milestone tracking)
3. Set up bi-weekly progress tracking
4. Manager alignment
5. Finalize in Rippling
