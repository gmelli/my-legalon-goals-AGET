## Wind Down Protocol

When user says "wind down" or "save work":
- Commit changes with descriptive message
- Create session notes in `sessions/SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Show completion summary

---

## Sign Off Protocol

When user says "sign off" or "all done":
- Quick save and exit
- No questions

---

## Session Management

### Session Notes Location
- Save to: `sessions/SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- NEVER save to root directory
- Use Session Metadata Standard v1.0 when applicable

### Goal Management Tasks
When working with goals:
- Store goal definitions in `data/goals/`
- Use structured formats (YAML, JSON, or Markdown)
- Include: goal name, objective, owner, status, milestones
- Track progress updates with timestamps

### Backgrounder Management
When working with backgrounders:
- Store documents in `data/backgrounders/`
- Use descriptive filenames
- Include metadata: date, author, purpose, related goals
- Maintain document versions if needed

---

## Key Integrations

This agent operates independently but coordinates with:
- **my-supervisor-AGET** - Fleet supervisor, receives status reports
- **Other GM-LEGALON agents** - Shares goal context and backgrounder materials

---

## Vocabulary Note
- `workspace/` = Your agent's private workspace for exploration
- `products/` = Public products you create/maintain for others
- `data/` = Persistent data storage (goals, backgrounders)
- `sessions/` = Session notes (timestamped)

---

## Naming Convention
**Suffix signals capability** (v2.4 framework convention):
- **-AGET** = Action-taking agent (‚ö†Ô∏è can modify systems)
- **-aget** = Information-only agent (‚úÖ read-only, reports, analysis)

This agent uses `-AGET` suffix, indicating it can create, modify, and delete goals and backgrounders.
