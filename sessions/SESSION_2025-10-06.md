# Session Notes - 2025-10-06

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Type:** Initial Setup & Goal Context Gathering
**Duration:** ~2-3 hours
**Agent:** my-legalon-goals-AGET v2.5.1

---

## Session Objective

Set up goals management agent and gather context for 2H FY2025 goal planning.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Agent Identity Established
- ✅ Created agent vision/mission/goals (`data/goals/agent_vision_mission_goals.md`)
- ✅ Created capabilities document (`docs/capabilities.md`)
- ✅ Updated README with VMG summary
- ✅ Set current priority: 2H FY2025 goal reporting (the crunch)

### 2. Context Gathered from CCB Handoff
- ✅ Read handoff document from my-ccb-AGET
- ✅ Created main backgrounder (`data/backgrounders/2025-10-05_legalon_2h_goal_planning.md`)
- ✅ Created CRB backgrounder (`data/backgrounders/contract_review_benchmark.md`)
- ✅ Captured decision tracking (`workspace/2h_goal_structure_decisions.md`)

### 3. Clarifying Questions Asked & Answered
- ✅ Q1 (AI Review F1 >= 0.9): COMPLETED via Ancalagon, don't carry to 2H
- ✅ Q2 (Thought Leadership): CRB engagement (still need metrics)
- ✅ Q3 (Time Savings): 10-minute contract review PoC, Q3 demo
- ✅ Q4 (SWAT Team): Implicit in US dev support
- ✅ Q5 (Goal Structure): Hybrid pattern (product + theme)
- ✅ Q6 (Product Coverage): Accuracy, Data Infrastructure, Team Building

### 4. Rippling Goals State Captured
- ✅ Created 1H FY2025 actual state document (`data/goals/1h_fy2025_rippling_actual.md`)
- ✅ Documented stale percentage problem (all 0% but work done)
- ✅ Captured 5 goals: AI Review, GenAI Hiring, Playbook Agent, MyPlaybook benchmark, Thought Leadership
- ✅ Updated GenAI Hiring to 50% (1 DS ✓, 1 GenAI Engineer KR)

### 5. LegalOn Product Hierarchy Documented
**Accuracy Umbrella:**
- AI Revise (automated redlining)
- AI Review (issue-spotting with Ancalagon LLM)
- Playbook Agent (custom guidelines, launching ~mid-Nov)

**Data Infrastructure:**
- Contract Database (public contracts, clauses, templates)
- LOA Session Analysis (expanded volume/depth)
- User-Session Data Capture (privacy/RTBF challenges)

**Key Technologies:**
- Ancalagon (custom LLM rule inference, achieved F1 >= 0.9)
- CRB - Contract Review Benchmark (nascently live, v2, genai-ops repo)

**Teams:**
- GenAI Team (Gabor's direct team)
- US Dev Team (2 AI Engineers + 2 SWEs, SWAT experiment)

### 6. Lessons Learned Documented
- ✅ Created lessons learned file (`.aget/evolution/2025-10-06_initial_setup_lessons.md`)
- ✅ What worked: systematic context gathering, question-driven approach
- ✅ What didn't: premature completion marking, verbose filenames
- ✅ Key insights: Rippling constraints, LegalOn products, goal patterns

---

## Key Decisions

### Structure
- **2H Goal Pattern:** Hybrid (product + theme based organization)
- **Goal Limits:** Max 5 goals, 4-5 key results each
- **Document Organization:** data/ (persistent), workspace/ (working), backgrounders/ (context)

### 2H Priorities Identified
1. Playbook Agent production launch (~mid-Nov)
2. CRB engagement (thought leadership, PR spear)
3. 10-minute contract review PoC (Q3 demo)
4. Contract Database (new data infrastructure)
5. LOA Session Analysis (expanded analysis)
6. User-Session Data Capture (privacy challenges)

### 1H Updates Needed
- AI Review: 0% → 100% (Ancalagon complete)
- GenAI Hiring: 50% (current, accurate)
- Playbook Agent: 0% → 50-75% (in progress)
- MyPlaybook benchmark: Status unclear, needs clarification
- Thought Leadership: Update based on CRB v2 completion

---

## Open Questions for Next Session

1. **CRB engagement metrics** - What defines success? (presentations? pilots? publications?)
2. **MyPlaybook benchmark status** - Goal #4 from 1H, what's the real progress?
3. **Time savings metric clarity** - Is 7.41% a real measure? Still relevant?
4. **Missing 1H goals** - Were there 7 goals total? CCB mentioned 2 not in Rippling data shown

---

2. Clarify MyPlaybook benchmark status
3. Confirm any missing 1H goals

### Goal Work
1. Update 1H percentages in Rippling (via Gabor)
2. Draft 2H goal structure (hybrid pattern)

# Session Notes - 2025-10-06 (Session 2)

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Type:** H1 FY2025 Final Results Review & Documentation
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Agent:** my-legalon-goals-AGET v2.5.1

---

## Session Objective

Review final H1 FY2025 results, update documentation, document lessons learned, prepare for H2 planning.

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. H1 FY2025 Final Results Captured
**Overall:** 81.67% completion (vs initial capture showing mostly 0%)

**Goal-by-Goal Review:**
1. ✅ **AI Review Accuracy**: 100% (Ancalagon + LIMA framework, F1 >= 0.9 achieved)
2. ✅ **GenAI Hiring**: 100% (Data Scientist ✓, NLP Engineer ✓ "under the wire", + DS backfill)
3. ⚠️ **Playbook Agent**: 33.33% (1 of 3 KRs: development complete, deployment/usage incomplete)
   - **Delays:** Nozo's shared infra decision (+2 months), Frontend blocked by LegalOn Premium
   - **H2 Carryover:** ~Nov 7 expected (Daniel wants Oct 23)
4. ⚠️ **MyPlaybook Benchmarking**: 75% (3 of 4 KRs complete)
   - NLU accuracy investigations didn't yield improvements
   - AI Revise v2 released (technically H2, backfilled to H1)
5. ✅ **Thought Leadership**: 100% (KDD2025 session chair: "Forecasting, Anomaly Detection and Resiliency")
   - Additional: Web Conference 2026 Area Chair, LinkedIn posts, LegalOn article

### 2. Documentation Updated

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `data/goals/1h_fy2025_rippling_actual.md`
  - Updated overall progress: 0% → 81.67%
  - Updated all 5 child goals with final percentages
  - Added delay analysis (Playbook Agent)
  - Documented backfilling issue (AI Revise v2)
  - Updated key observations and action items

- ✅ `docs/capabilities.md`
  - Updated "Current State - 1H FY2025" → "H1 FY2025 Final Results"
  - Added 81.67% completion summary
  - Updated 2H priorities with "1H percentages updated" checkmark
  - Added bi-weekly progress tracking action

**Files Created:**
- ✅ `data/goals/1h_fy2025_lessons_learned.md`
  - What worked: Technical goals with clear metrics, hiring goals, low-bar thought leadership, flat structure
  - What didn't work: Tracking system failure (0% syndrome), external dependencies, accuracy improvement risks, backfilling
  - Patterns confirmed: Hiring always 100%, presentations inconsistent, product launches have timeline risk
  - Process improvements for H2: Bi-weekly updates, milestone-based tracking, dependency flagging, hybrid structure

### 3. Key Insights Documented

**Tracking System Failure (CRITICAL):**
- Company-wide pattern: goals show 0% despite completed work
- Root cause: "Set and forget" mentality, no update triggers, Rippling UI friction
- Impact: Undermines credibility, makes goal system non-functional
- Solution: Bi-weekly progress updates (calendar reminder), milestone tracking

**Pattern Confirmation:**
- Hiring goals: Always 100% (2H FY2024, 1H FY2025) - reliable, safe bets
- Technical goals with clear metrics: High completion rate
- Product launches with external dependencies: Timeline risk, need buffers

**Backfilling Issue:**
- AI Revise v2 (released Oct 2025, after H1 expired) counted toward H1 goal
- Creates confusion about period boundaries
- Lesson: Be disciplined about what counts when

### 4. Process Improvements Identified for H2

1. **Bi-weekly progress updates** (NEW) - Solve stale percentage problem
2. **Milestone-based tracking** (ENHANCED) - Clear completion criteria
3. **Dependency flagging** (NEW) - Explicit tracking of blockers
4. **Hybrid goal structure** (PLANNED) - Better organization for complex H2

---

## Key Decisions

- ✅ H1 final results are 81.67% (strong delivery despite tracking failures)
- ✅ Process fix: bi-weekly updates mandatory for H2
- ✅ Playbook Agent carries to H2 (~Nov 7 target)
- ✅ Lessons learned document created for future reference

---

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `data/goals/1h_fy2025_lessons_learned.md`

### Modified
- `data/goals/1h_fy2025_rippling_actual.md` (updated with final results)
- `docs/capabilities.md` (updated H1 summary, H2 priorities)
- `sessions/SESSION_2025-10-06.md` (this file - appended session 2 notes)

---

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate
1. Commit and push all H1 documentation
2. Begin H2 goal structure drafting
3. Apply lessons learned to H2 planning process

### H2 Planning Work
1. Draft 2H goals using hybrid structure
2. Flag dependencies explicitly
