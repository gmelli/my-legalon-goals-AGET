## Child Goals (All 0%, All Expired)

### 1. AI Review accuracy at >= 0.9 F1 for >= 90% of rules four contract types
- **Status:** Expired
- **Progress:** 0% / 100%
- **Actual Reality:** ✅ COMPLETED via Ancalagon project (custom LLM rule inference)

### 2. GenAI Hiring
- **Status:** Expired
- **Progress:** 50% / 100% (UPDATED by Gabor)

**Key Results in Rippling:**
1. "one GenAI Data Scientist hired" - ✅ Completed
2. "one GenAI Engineer hired" - ⏳ (Status unclear, goal at 50%)

**Actual Hiring Reality (broader context):**
- 1 GenAI Data Scientist ✓ (tracked in KR)
- 1 Data Scientist backfill ✓ (NOT in KR, but happened)
- NLP Engineer signed ✓ (NOT in KR, but happened)
- 2 AI Engineers pending for US dev team / SWAT experiment (NOT in KR)

**Gap:** Rippling tracks 2 KRs, but actual hiring was broader (backfill, NLP, AI Engineers for SWAT)

### 3. MyPlaybook Agent used in production
- **Status:** Expired
- **Progress:** 0% / 100%
- **Actual Reality:** IN PROGRESS
  - Actual name: "Playbook Agent" (not "MyPlaybook Agent")
  - Production launch: ~mid-Nov (Q2 start → 2H completion)

### 4. MyPlaybook benchmarked and accuracy increased
- **Status:** Expired
- **Progress:** 0% / 100%
- **Actual Reality:** UNKNOWN - need to clarify status

### 5. Thought leadership
- **Status:** Expired
- **Progress:** 0% / 100%
- **Actual Reality:** IN PROGRESS
  - CRB nascently live, v2 complete
  - Needs external engagement/positioning in 2H

---

## Key Observations

1. **Stale percentages confirmed:** All show 0% but significant work completed
2. **Flat structure:** Pattern A (simple key results under parent goal)
3. **No descriptions:** Goals have no detailed descriptions in system
4. **Timeline mismatch:** Several goals span 1H → 2H (Playbook Agent, CRB engagement)

---

## Action Items for 1H Update

1. Update AI Review to 100% (Ancalagon completion)
2. Update GenAI Hiring to ~75% (2 DS + NLP complete, 2 AI Eng pending)
3. Update Playbook Agent to ~50-75% (in progress, launching Q2)
4. Clarify MyPlaybook benchmark status
5. Update Thought Leadership to reflect CRB v2 completion
