# H1 FY2025 Lessons Learned

**Period:** 1st half of FY2025 (04/01/2025 - 09/30/2025)
**Overall Result:** 81.67% completion
**Documented:** 2025-10-06

---

## Executive Summary

H1 FY2025 delivered strong technical results (81.67% completion) with three perfect completions out of five goals. However, tracking system failures obscured this success - most goals showed 0% until final review, undermining credibility and making goal management non-functional.

**Core problem identified:** Work gets done, but tracking doesn't happen until review time. This is solvable.

## What Worked Well ✅

### 1. Focused Technical Goals with Clear Metrics
**AI Review Accuracy (100%)**
- **What:** Achieve F1 >= 0.9 for >= 90% of rules across four contract types
- **Why it worked:**
  - Clear, measurable target
  - Technical deliverable with definitive completion criteria
  - Single team ownership (GenAI team)
  - No external dependencies
- **Lesson:** SMART goals with technical metrics are easiest to complete and verify

### 2. Hiring Goals Complete Reliably
**GenAI Hiring (100%)**
- **Pattern confirmed:** Hiring goals consistently hit 100% (see: 2H FY2024, 1H FY2025)
- **Why it works:**
  - Binary completion (hired = done)
  - High organizational priority
  - Clear accountability
  - Gabor personally involved
- **Lesson:** Hiring goals are safe bets - always set them, always complete them

### 3. Thought Leadership Low Bar = High Success
**Thought Leadership (100%)**
- **What:** 1 public presentation (KDD2025 session chair)
- **Why it worked:**
  - Low bar (1 presentation)
  - Leveraged existing commitments (KDD Area Chair role)
  - Natural byproduct of professional involvement
- **Lesson:** Set thought leadership bars realistically to ensure completion

### 4. Flat Goal Structure (Pattern A)
- **Simple structure:** Parent goal → 5 direct child goals
- **Why it worked:**
  - Easy to understand
  - Easy to track
  - No complex dependencies
  - Matches Rippling's native model
- **Lesson:** For individual contributors, flat structure works well

## What Didn't Work ❌

### 1. Tracking System Failure - Critical Problem
**Symptom:** Most goals showed 0% despite significant completed work
**Impact:**
- Undermines credibility during reviews
- Makes goal system non-functional
- Creates last-minute scramble to reconstruct reality
- Company-wide pattern (not just Gabor's problem)

**Root causes identified:**
- No habit of updating percentages as work completes
- No triggers/reminders to update tracking
- Rippling UI friction (manual entry required)
- "Set and forget" mentality after goal creation

**Lesson:** Process must include **regular progress updates** (bi-weekly or monthly), not just final review.

### 2. External Dependencies Kill Timelines
**Playbook Agent (33.33%)**
- **Delays:**
  - Nozo's shared infra decision: +2 months
  - Frontend blocked by LegalOn Premium project
- **Team was ready, but couldn't deliver**

**Lesson:**
- Flag external dependencies explicitly in goal structure
- Consider "team readiness" vs "delivery readiness" separately
- Build buffer time for cross-team dependencies
- H2 approach: Track what you control, acknowledge what you don't

### 3. Accuracy Improvement Goals are Risky
**MyPlaybook Benchmarking (75%)**
- **What failed:** "NLU accuracy increased (against benchmark)" - investigations didn't yield improvements
- **Why it's risky:** Assumes improvement is achievable, but diminishing returns may block progress

**Lesson:**
- Frame as "investigate accuracy improvements" rather than "increase accuracy"
- Or: Set lower bar for what counts as improvement
- Or: Make it exploratory rather than success-oriented

### 4. Backfilling H2 Work to H1 Goals
**AI Revise v2** (released Oct 2025, after H1 expired) counted toward H1 "MyPlaybooks NLG optimized" KR

**Problem:**
- Technically outside H1 period (expired 09/30/2025)
- Creates confusion about what "counts"
- Questionable practice for goal integrity

**Lesson:**
- Be disciplined about period boundaries
- H2 work should count toward H2 goals
- If carryover happens, document it explicitly

## Patterns Confirmed

### 1. Hiring Goals: Always 100%
- **2H FY2024:** Hiring goals completed
- **1H FY2025:** GenAI hiring 100%
- **Pattern:** Hiring is high-priority, binary completion, well-supported
- **Action:** Always include 1-2 hiring goals for reliable completions

### 2. Presentation Goals: Inconsistent
- **H1 FY2025:** 100% (1 presentation delivered - KDD2025)
- **Historical pattern:** Presentations often incomplete in prior cycles
- **Difference:** Low bar (1 presentation) + leveraged existing commitment
- **Action:** Keep presentation bars low (1-2), tie to existing commitments

### 3. Product Launch Goals: Timeline Risk
- **Playbook Agent:** Delayed despite team readiness
- **Pattern:** Product launches have external dependencies, timeline slippage common
- **Action:**
  - Build buffer time into targets
  - Consider phased KRs (development → deployment → usage)
  - Track "team readiness" separately from "launch completion"

## Process Improvements for H2

### 1. **Bi-Weekly Progress Updates** (NEW)
- **Problem:** Goals stale until final review
- **Solution:** Every 2 weeks, update percentages in Rippling
- **Trigger:** Add to calendar as recurring task
- **Owner:** This agent (with Gabor's input)

### 2. **Milestone-Based Tracking** (ENHANCED)
- **Problem:** Hard to estimate percentage completion
- **Solution:** Break goals into clear milestones, track milestone completion
- **Example:** Playbook Agent → 3 milestones (dev, deploy, usage) = 33% each

### 3. **Dependency Flagging** (NEW)
- **Problem:** External dependencies surprise us
- **Solution:** Explicitly tag goals with dependencies in descriptions
- **Format:** "Depends on: [Team/Project/Person]"
- **Action:** Review dependencies monthly

### 4. **Hybrid Structure for H2** (PLANNED)
- **Why:** H2 has both technical goals and strategic initiatives
- **Pattern B (nested):** Group related KRs under goal umbrellas
- **Benefit:** Better organization, clearer relationships

## Key Takeaways

1. **H1 was successful** - 81.67% completion, three perfect goals, strong technical delivery
2. **Tracking failed** - Stale percentages created false narrative of 0% progress
3. **Process fix needed** - Bi-weekly updates, milestone tracking, dependency awareness
4. **Hiring remains reliable** - Always complete, always set these goals
5. **External dependencies kill timelines** - Flag them, buffer for them, track what you control
6. **Flat structure worked well** - Keep it for H2 unless complexity demands nested structure

## Actions for H2

**Immediate (before goal creation):**
- [ ] Establish bi-weekly progress update cadence (calendar reminder)
- [ ] Create milestone-based tracking template
- [ ] Document known dependencies for H2 priorities

**During H2 (ongoing):**
- [ ] Update Rippling percentages bi-weekly (no more stale goals!)
- [ ] Review dependencies monthly
- [ ] Document blockers as they occur
- [ ] Flag timeline risks early

**End of H2 (review):**
- [ ] Capture H2 lessons learned
- [ ] Compare H1 vs H2 process effectiveness
- [ ] Refine for FY2026
